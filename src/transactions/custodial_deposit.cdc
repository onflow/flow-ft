// This transaction is a template for a transaction that could be
//used by anyone to deposit their tokens into a central contract that is
// controlled by a custodial entity like an exchange.
// They would specify a user ID in the transaction so that
// the deposit would emit an event that indicates which account
// should be credited.
//
// The custodial service would simply create this transaction from a
// template, filling in the necessary fields, and have the user
// sign the transaction to deposit their funds.
//
// The withdraw amount and the account from getAccount
// would be the parameters to the transaction
