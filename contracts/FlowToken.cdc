/**

# FlowToken example contract

This is an example implementation of the Flow Fungible Token standard.
Is not part of the standard, but just shows how most tokens
should implement the standard, including the Flow network token itself.

The FlowToken contract only needs to be deployed in one account.
The only part of the contract that would be stored in each user's account
is the Vault object, below

The implementation does not need to redefine the interfaces that are
already defined in the Fungible Token interface
