/**

# Fungible Token Forwarding Contract

This contract shows how an account could set up a custom FungibleToken Receiver
to allow them to forward tokens to a different account whenever they receive tokens.

They can publish this Forwarder resource as a Receiver capability just like a Vault,
and the sender doesn't even need to know it is different.

When an account wants to create a Forwarder, they call the createNewForwarder
function and provide it with the Receiver reference that they want to forward
their tokens to.
